Amazon-Dynamo
=============

This was an academic project in Distributed Systems via Android programming where we areasked to focus only on the content provider part of the app and do not worry too much about the UI.

In order to run this app install the apk on any android emulator and press the insert button and query button to test it inorder to test it on multiple emulators just install it on all of them let the dynamo ring be formed and run it simultaneously.

The aim of this project was to provide following functionality:

Simplified Dynamo

Tools and Skills used : Java | Android | Distributed Systems | SQLite | Multi-Threading |Eclipse

Simplified implementation of Dynamo: Amazon's Highly Available Key-value Store.

Completely decentralized distributed system for data storage(Distributed Hash Table).

Achieves scalability and availability by 
1) Data partitioning 
2) Data replication using consistent hashing,
Consistency is facilitated by object versioning and quorums
