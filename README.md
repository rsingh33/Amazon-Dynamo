Amazon-Dynamo
=============
Simplified Dynamo
Java | Android | Distributed Systems | SQLite | Multi-Threading
Simplified implementation of Dynamo: Amazon's Highly Available Key-value Store.
Completely decentralized distributed system for data storage(Distributed Hash Table).
Achieves scalability and availability by 
1) Data partitioning 
2) Data replication using consistent hashing,
3) Node Failure handling mechanism.
Consistency is facilitated by object versioning and quorums
